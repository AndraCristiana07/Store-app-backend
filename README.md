<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A store application where you can buy the groceries you need. 


* Here is the backend side of my [store app](https://github.com/AndraCristiana07/Store-app)
The products and the users are stored in a table with sqlite and all the API calls are done in the server.ts.
The creation and modifications of the tables are done from the server.ts file.


### Built With
